##  Description
The Employee Content Management System (ECMS) is a command-line application built using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL. It provides business owners with a convenient and efficient solution for managing their company's employee database. With ECMS, users can easily view, organize, and update information related to departments, roles, and employees, enabling effective business planning and organization.

This application fulfills the needs of business owners by offering a range of essential features. Upon starting the application, users are presented with a menu of options to choose from. They can view all departments, roles, and employees, add new departments, roles, and employees, as well as update an employee's role.

When viewing departments, ECMS displays a formatted table that showcases department names and their corresponding IDs. Similarly, when viewing roles, users are presented with detailed information, including job titles, role IDs, associated departments, and salaries. For employee data, a formatted table is presented, containing employee IDs, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and the managers to whom employees report.

Adding a department, role, or employee is intuitive and prompts the user to enter the relevant information, such as department name, role details (name, salary, department), and employee details (first name, last name, role, manager). The entered data is then seamlessly added to the database, ensuring accurate and up-to-date records.

For updating an employee's role, the application guides the user through selecting the employee to be updated and choosing their new role. The information is then updated in the database, maintaining consistency and reflecting any changes made.

Overall, the Employee Content Management System (ECMS) empowers business owners to efficiently manage their employee database through a command-line interface. By providing an array of features, including viewing, adding, and updating information, ECMS streamlines organizational processes, allowing business owners to effectively plan and organize their operations.

##  Overview
